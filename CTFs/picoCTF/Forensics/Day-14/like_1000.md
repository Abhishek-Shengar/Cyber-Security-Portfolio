## Challenge Name
like1000

## Category
Forensics

## Difficulty
Medium

## Description / Problem Statement
**Author:** Danny  

This .tar file got tarred a lot.

Download Link: https://challenge-files.picoctf.net/c_fickle_tempest/dc6349af33fec5413fe968b12506dde81953fdab2214acb3eaaf0b96cfff5dc4/1000.tar

---

## Objective
To extract recursively nested tar archives and recover the final hidden file.

---

## Tools / Commands Used
- Linux Terminal
- `wget`
- `file`
- `ls`
- `foremost`
- `eog`

---

## Methodology

1. Copied the download link from the challenge page.
2. Opened a terminal in **Linux**.
3. Downloaded the file:
```bash
wget https://challenge-files.picoctf.net/c_fickle_tempest/dc6349af33fec5413fe968b12506dde81953fdab2214acb3eaaf0b96cfff5dc4/1000.tar
```
4. Verified the file type:
```bash
file 1000.tar
```
5. Confirmed that the file was a TAR archive.

6. Instead of manually extracting each nested TAR file one by one, used the foremost tool to perform file carving directly on the archive:
```bash
foremost 1000.tar
```
7. The tool scanned the archive and created an output directory named:
```bash
output
```
8. Navigated into the output directory:
```bash
cd output
```
9. Listed the recovered file categories:
```bash
ls
```
10. Observed a directory named png containing recovered PNG files.
11. Navigated into the PNG directory:
```bash
cd png
```
12. Identified the recovered image file (e.g., 00000000.png or similar).
13. Opened the recovered image:
```bash
eog 00000000.png
```
13. The image displayed the flag.

## Summary

This challenge demonstrated **recursive archive analysis and file carving techniques**.

Although the TAR file contained multiple nested archives, instead of extracting each layer manually, I used the `foremost` tool to carve embedded files directly from the root archive. Foremost identified and recovered the hidden PNG file based on file signatures, allowing retrieval of the flag without repetitive extraction.

This challenge highlights the flexibility of forensic approaches and reinforces the importance of understanding both structured extraction and file carving methodologies.
