# Day 14 – picoCTF Forensics Challenge

## Challenge Name
like1000

## Category
Forensics

## Difficulty
Medium

## Description / Problem Statement
**Author:** Danny  

This .tar file got tarred a lot.

Download Link: https://challenge-files.picoctf.net/c_fickle_tempest/dc6349af33fec5413fe968b12506dde81953fdab2214acb3eaaf0b96cfff5dc4/1000.tar

---

## Objective
To extract recursively nested tar archives and recover the final hidden file.

---

## Tools / Commands Used
- Linux Terminal
- `wget`
- `file`
- `ls`
- `eog`

---

## Methodology

1. Copied the download link from the challenge page.
2. Opened a terminal in **Linux**.
3. Downloaded the file:
```bash
wget https://challenge-files.picoctf.net/c_fickle_tempest/dc6349af33fec5413fe968b12506dde81953fdab2214acb3eaaf0b96cfff5dc4/1000.tar
```
4. Verified the file type:
```bash
file 1000.tar
```
5. Confirmed that the file was a TAR archive.
6. Extracted the archive:
```bash
tar -xf 1000.tar
```
7. After extraction, a new archive appeared:
```bash
999.tar
```
8. Recognized that the challenge involved recursive nested tar files, each decreasing in number.
9. Repeated the extraction process multiple times:
```bash
tar -xf 999.tar
tar -xf 998.tar
...
```
10. Continued extracting each resulting archive until reaching the final extracted contents.
11. Eventually discovered a PNG file:
```bash
flag.png
```
12. Opened the image file:
```bash
eog flag.png
```
13. The image displayed the flag.

## Summary

This challenge demonstrated **recursive archive extraction and nested file structures**.

The original TAR file contained another TAR file repeatedly, similar to layers of compression stacked inside one another. By systematically extracting each archive layer, I was able to reach the final embedded image containing the flag. This challenge reinforced the importance of recognizing recursive archive patterns and automating repetitive extraction tasks when necessary.
