## Methodology

1. Opened the challenge URL in a web browser.
2. The homepage displayed a list of people with their names and quotes.

3. Opened the side menu and selected **Admin Login**.

4. The Admin Login page displayed an input field requesting a password.

5. Inspected the page source using **Ctrl + U**, but no credentials or flag were found.
6. Attempted a classic SQL Injection payload: ' OR 1=1;--

7. The application returned an error message: SQLite3::query(): Unable to prepare statement
indicating that:
- The backend database was **SQLite**
- Input was being filtered or transformed before execution

8. From the error behavior and challenge context, inferred that **SQL keywords were being filtered or modified**.
9. Researched and identified that this application applies **ROT13 encoding** to certain SQL keywords.
10. Since:
 ```
 or  → be  (ROT13)
 ```
11. Crafted a ROT13-encoded SQL Injection payload: ' be 1=1;--
 ```
 ' be 1=1;--
 ```
12. Submitted the payload in the password field.
13. The backend decoded the input internally, reconstructing a valid SQL condition.
14. Authentication was bypassed, and admin access was granted.
15. The application revealed the flag.
